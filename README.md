# wagner-test

A test repo space for the Wagner's to test and play around.

## Ideas for the Wagner repo:

-   Let's conduct an exploratory data analysis using JW's Spotify data, because that contains a variety of .json files. I'll do some coding in R and HW can use JavaScript and we can follow each other's analysis' and see if we find the same / different explorations. This way we can learn from each other's code and JW can practice using Issues and GitHub workflow.

    -   JW to ask HW about best practices migrating files between repos, as my current scripts for spotify analysis is in a different repo.

-   I'd like our motto to be something like: "Keep it simple, focus on learning".

    -   I'd like to focus on small projects focused on a specific theme.

    -   Example: exploratory data analysis on JW's Spotify data. Clear focus task on a relatively small dataset.

-   I'd also be keen to do some very simple learnings with HTML and particularly CSS.

## Questions for HW:

-   Is NodeJS for JavaScript the equivalent of RStudio for R?

-   Do you have any simple examples of the uses of JavaScript that you've directly worked on?

-   What kind of data analysis (if any) have you done with JavaScript?
